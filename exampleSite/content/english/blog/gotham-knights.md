description: This is the way to get 60FPS.

The suggested PC specs for Gotham Knights have been affirmed, on the ball discharge on Friday, and definitely stand out enough to be noticed for a portion of its prerequisites.

The specs were shared on Twitter the previous evening, only days before the game's delivery this Friday.

The game's Steam posting has been refreshed to mirror the specs, alongside the base PC prerequisites that distributer Warner Brothers. recently affirmed before in the week.

Como actualización, las determinaciones básicas son:

Procesador: Intel Center i5-9600K o Ryzen 5 3600

Memoria: 8GB Smash

Tarjeta de ilustraciones: Geforce GTX 1660 Ti o Radeon RX 590

Capacidad: 60GB

This will play at an expected 60FPS at 1080p on the most minimal settings.

Las determinaciones sugeridas son:

Procesador: Intel Center i7-10700K o Ryzen 5 5600X

Memoria: 16GB

Tarjeta de ilustraciones: Geforce RTX 2070 o Radeon RX 5700 XT

Capacidad: 60GB

Esto debería darle 60FPS a 1080p en configuraciones altas.

Reactions to the specs have been confounded and disheartened. For a game running at 1080p, that is a really powerful setting you really want.
