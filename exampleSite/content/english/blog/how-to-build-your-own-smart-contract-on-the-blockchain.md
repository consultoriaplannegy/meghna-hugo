Smart contracts drive much of the value of blockchain technology, with companies implementing them to manage digital transactions. For example, in a supply chain where multiple parties are involved, a smart contract can be used to track inventory and automatically transfer it from one party to another when needed. These contracts work by having pre-programmed conditions that must be met for something to happen; for example, that the second party receives the inventory once the first party has less than a certain amount left. The conditions are written in code and stored in an immutable blockchain network. Once these contracts have been deployed and recorded in the ledger, they are autonomously executed as if they were set in stone. There are different ways to build your own smart contract on the blockchain

#### How do smart contracts work?

Smart contracts store and manage data that is paired with a specific address on the blockchain. At this address, anyone can see the data, but only the person who has the private key can make changes to it. When you want to make changes to a particular smart contract, you have to deploy it again with the new data. This means you can't just edit an existing smart contract; you have to make a new contract with the new data and new address.

#### Introduction to Ethereum

Ethereum was one of the first blockchain protocols dedicated to smart contracts. It has served as both a platform for people to build on and a testing ground for new ideas in smart contract theory and implementation. Ethereum is a decentralized network where anyone can run nodes. These nodes are responsible for validating and executing smart contracts. Many companies are choosing to build their platforms on Ethereum, both for internal operations and for customer services.

#### Solidity: Writing smart contracts in blockchain languages.

Solidity is a programming language created for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. This language is Turing complete, which means it can solve any problem that a computer can solve. Any code written in this language is automatically deployed as a smart contract and added to the blockchain, which acts as a decentralized, auditable database.

#### Why learn how to write smart contracts?

Learning to write your own smart contract has many advantages. The most notable is that you can fluidly manage digital assets and automate transactions using pre-programmed rules. You can also speed up business processes involving multiple parties by automating them with blockchain technology. This includes supply chain management and processing government services such as tax refunds. For example, smart contracts can be used to automate tax refunds by tracking when and to whom the refund is due and then automatically transferring the funds.

#### Learning how to write your own smart contract is just the beginning.

Once you have written your own smart contract and deployed it on the blockchain, there are still many ways to extend its functionality. You can use other programming languages or you can add or remove rules from your smart contract to give it new functions or change existing ones. In addition, you can also create your own decentralized application (or DApp) that runs on top of your contract. DApps are built on blockchain technology and can be hosted on decentralized networks.

#### What you will need to build your own smart contract

\- Time - Building your own smart contract will take time and effort, especially if it's your first time working with blockchain technologies. However, you can start with a simple program to get the hang of coding your own contract. - Skill - You will need to master at least one programming language. Some of the most common programming languages used for smart contract development are Python, C, C++ and Solidity. - Computer - You will need a computer with an Internet connection. You can write your program on any computer, but you will need to deploy your contract on a blockchain network.

#### Deploying a smart contract on the blockchain: Step by step.

\- Get your code - First, you'll need to write your code. This is straightforward if you're using Solidity, but if you're using another language, you'll need to find documentation that explains the syntax of your chosen language. - Deploy your contract - Next, you'll need to deploy your contract to a blockchain network. You can use an online blockchain explorer to deploy your contract manually or use a development environment where you can deploy your contract directly. - Set your contract address - Finally, you will need to set the address of your contract. The contract address is unique for each contract and can be used to read code and data from your contract.
